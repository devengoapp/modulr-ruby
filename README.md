## Release

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, on main branch update the version number in `version.rb`, then:

```git
bundle exec rake install
git add .
git commit -m 'Update version file and gemfile'
git push
git tag vx.x.x main
git push origin vx.x.x
```

The tagging will trigger the GitHub action defined in `release.yml`, pushing the gem to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Tooling for manual API testing

We have a tooling system based on HTTP request files which allow developers to run pre-format Modulr API requests easily. These HTTP request files are stored inside `doc/modulr_requests` directory. Find the service you want to run and run the specific HTTP file to execute the request locally.

We run these requests locally from our favorite IDEs, in our case, we use ([IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/) has a native feature that allows you to run these requests easily but if you are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you will need to install the following extension [httpYac](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anweber.vscode-httpyac).

To configure the HTTP files system create a new `modulr-ruby/doc/modulr_requests/http-client.private.env.json` from `modulr-ruby/doc/modulr_requests/http-client.env.json` file.
Configure all variables by environment and you are ready to use your HTTP files.

## Testing

Any change should be tested. Builds with failures would not be allowed to merge.
To run your test suite locally using Rspec:

```rb
bundle exec rspec
```

To prepare your environment to listen for your local code changes use Guard instead:

```rb
bundle exec guard
```

To test services, we have a spec system that uses the [Webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) library to stub requests and checks them against service response HTTP format files.
These HTTP files are stored in the `spec/fixtures` directory.
